# Chat App Frontend

This is the frontend for a real-time chat application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Ant Design**. It connects to the backend via REST APIs and WebSockets to provide a seamless chat experience.

## Features

- Interactive and responsive user interface with **Ant Design**
- Real-time messaging with **Socket.IO Client**
- Routing with **React Router DOM**
- API integration using **Axios**
- Modular and type-safe components with **TypeScript**

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

## Technologies Used

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Ant Design** - UI framework for consistent design
- **Socket.IO Client** - Real-time communication
- **Axios** - Promise-based HTTP client
- **Webpack** - Module bundler

## Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the app for production
- `npm test` - Run the test suite
- `npm run eject` - Eject the app configuration (use with caution)

## Environment Variables

To configure the frontend, create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Replace the URLs with the backend server's address.
